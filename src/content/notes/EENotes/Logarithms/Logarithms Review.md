A **logarithm** is simply the inverse of an exponential function. It answers the question: "What exponent do I need to raise a specific base to, to get a certain number?"
### The Relationship Between Exponents and Logarithms

An exponential equation and a logarithmic equation can express the exact same relationship.

The exponential statement:

$$ 2^4 = 16 $$


is perfectly equivalent to the logarithmic statement:

$$ \log_{2}(16) = 4 $$

Both statements express the same fact: the base **2** must be raised to the power of **4** to get the number **16**. "What power do I need to raise 2 to, to get 16?" 4.

### Example

Let's evaluate the expression:

$$\log_{3}(81) = x$$

This is asking, "To what power ($x$) must we raise the base **3** to get **81**?"

We can rewrite this as an exponential equation:

$$3^x = 81$$

By testing powers of 3, we find:

$$3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 3^4 = 81$$

Therefore, $x=4$.

$$\log_{3}(81) = 4$$
