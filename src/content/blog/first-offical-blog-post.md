# Introduction

Hello, My name is Ashby, I'm a 26 year old second year Electrical engineering student.

I want to begin working on personal projects and further my learning in general. This blog will serve as a place where I can stay motivated and on track.

This blog will consists of mainly 2 things (for now..)

1.  A place to log my progress on EE including personal projects and hurdles of knowledge that i cross

2.  A place for findings and general information that can be of value to someone
